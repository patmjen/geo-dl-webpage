      <description>Shihav presentation Presentation can be downloaded here.
In this presenation Shihav presented a different approach compared to the multiview rendering and volumentric representations. The spectral CNN approach (paper) is more focused on local represenation of points in a point cloud or a mesh. The method requires the graph laplacian and works by doing convolution as multiplication in the spectral domain. The in turn also yields a canonical representation of the 3D objects using functional maps.</description>

      <description>Kristine presentation Presentation can be downloaded here.
In this meeting Kristine presented the results from the paper Cascade Multi-view Hourglass Model for Robust 3D Face Alignment. This builds on the original hourglass paper. The idea is to have two original hourglass networks trained end to end. The first one creates probability maps for the annotations points, and the second refines the predicitons and reduces variation. The explore several different variants compared to a baseline implementation.</description>
