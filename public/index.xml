      <description>Presentation can be found here.
Surveys current (as of 2020) methods used for geometric deep learning as well as a list of datasets with links, and some pointers on open problems. Also gives theoretical background but not as well as Bronstein et al., 2016. For graphs both spectral and spatial methods are covered and it is noted that spatial methods (which simply aggregates neighbor features) are winning out over more complicated spectral ones.</description>

      <description>Our aim with this journal club is to strengthen our knowledge of the cutting edge research in geometric deep learning. The current format is to meet every Tuesday from 14:30 to 15:30 where one of the participants presents a paper related to geometric deep learning which followed by discussion. The summary of the presentations will be added here as a post.
The current team is:

      <title>Cycle GANs</title>

      <description>Gudmundur presentation The presentation can be found here.
In the presentation I went into the fundamental ideas behind cycle GANs and what they can be used for, most notable image to image translation and image synthesis. There are few notable things about the cycle GAN paper, one of the main is how well all the major ideas are presented. The paper is a joy to read, and if you have not read it already, I highly recommend it.</description>

      <description>Gudmundur presentation I will upload a summary of the presentation, along with the presentation itself after the journal club meeting, which is scheduled for the 3rd of October.
For now, those who are eager to get a headstart on GANs, I recommend reading the original paper by Ian Goodfellow et al. This original paper from 2014 has currently been cited almost 5000 times. I will also try to find some more up to date material, I will progressively update this post with papers and blog posts relevant for the presentation.</description>

      <title>Synchronized spectral CNN for 3D SHape Segmentation</title>

      <description>Shihav presentation Presentation can be downloaded here.
In this presenation Shihav presented a different approach compared to the multiview rendering and volumentric representations. The spectral CNN approach (paper) is more focused on local represenation of points in a point cloud or a mesh. The method requires the graph laplacian and works by doing convolution as multiplication in the spectral domain. The in turn also yields a canonical representation of the 3D objects using functional maps.</description>

      <description>Vladimir presentation Presentation can be downloaded here.
Vladimir presented the results from the first pointNet paper. The main application is classificaiton and segmentation of point clouds. The method is made to be invariant to the permutations of the points in the pointcloud, i.e. order of the points should not matter.</description>

      <description>Kristine presentation Presentation can be downloaded here.
In this meeting Kristine presented the results from the paper Cascade Multi-view Hourglass Model for Robust 3D Face Alignment. This builds on the original hourglass paper. The idea is to have two original hourglass networks trained end to end. The first one creates probability maps for the annotations points, and the second refines the predicitons and reduces variation. The explore several different variants compared to a baseline implementation.</description>

      <description>Rasmus 1st presentation Presentation can be downloaded here.
In the first session Rasmus presented results and approaches from the papers Multi-view Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Shape Recognition and Volumetric and Multi-View CNNs for Object Classification on 3D Data. Both papers are about classification of 3D-shape data, the first one creates multiple different renderings, which are passed through the same CNN and view-pooled. The second paper takes a model and transforms it into a voxalized representation before feeding it into a CNN.</description>
