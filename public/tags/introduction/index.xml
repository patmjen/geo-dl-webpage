      <description>Gudmundur presentation The presentation can be found here.
In the presentation I went into the fundamental ideas behind cycle GANs and what they can be used for, most notable image to image translation and image synthesis. There are few notable things about the cycle GAN paper, one of the main is how well all the major ideas are presented. The paper is a joy to read, and if you have not read it already, I highly recommend it.</description>

      <description>Gudmundur presentation I will upload a summary of the presentation, along with the presentation itself after the journal club meeting, which is scheduled for the 3rd of October.
For now, those who are eager to get a headstart on GANs, I recommend reading the original paper by Ian Goodfellow et al. This original paper from 2014 has currently been cited almost 5000 times. I will also try to find some more up to date material, I will progressively update this post with papers and blog posts relevant for the presentation.</description>
