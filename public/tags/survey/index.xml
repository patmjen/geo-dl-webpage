      <description>Presentation can be found here.
Surveys current (as of 2020) methods used for geometric deep learning as well as a list of datasets with links, and some pointers on open problems. Also gives theoretical background but not as well as Bronstein et al., 2016. For graphs both spectral and spatial methods are covered and it is noted that spatial methods (which simply aggregates neighbor features) are winning out over more complicated spectral ones.</description>
