# IACG Journal club for geometric deep learning

This journal club is a continuation of an earlier version started by [Rasmus R. Paulsen](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~rapa/) and [Gudmundur Einarsson](https://gumeo.github.io/) (Now alumni).
Our aim is to strengthen the internal knowledge of the cutting edge research in geometric deep learning.
The current format is to meet every Tuesday from 14:30 to 15:30 where one of the participants presents a paper related to geometric deep learning which followed by discussion.
